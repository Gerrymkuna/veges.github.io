        Rastan herb farm and store we pride ourselves in growing superior
        quality field and greenhouse fruits and vegetables. We presently operate
        a 3-acre greenhousethat is heated by two natural gas boilers. In the
        greenhouse, crops are grown biologically; meaning that we introduce
        natural predators instead of spraying chemical pesticides to kill the
        pests. The common pests found on peppers are aphids. The predators used
        to target these pests are purchased from around the world and are
        introduced into the greenhouse on a weekly basi. We choose our variety
        of tomatoes carefully so that our customers receive the maximum flavor.
        Long English cucmbers , mini cucmbers, eggplant, beans, carrots are also
        grown in the greenhouse. Greenhouse harvest begins in February and
        continues until Decemberwhen we clean out the greenhouses to replant.

        Working ourselves was not our target but we have a big cooperation with
        the local outsiders, we connect our farms and ideas to the local farmer
        around our community and try to empower them with ne technology and
        farming skills. Our main goal is to change the farming system from the
        farms to the flow of products in the markets by using the sustainable
        means. We make daily follow up on the local farms from the process of
        sustainable replanting of the fruits and vegetables, sustainable growth
        and care and finalizing with harvesting seasons.
